### Batch Nomrmalization layer params
- 
- axis: Integer, the axis that should be normalized (typically the features axis). For instance, after a Conv2D layer with data_format="channels_first", set axis=1 in BatchNormalization.

- momentum: Momentum for the moving average.

- epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.

- center: If True, add offset of beta to normalized tensor. If False, beta is ignored.

- scale: If True, multiply by gamma. If False, gamma is not used. When the next layer is linear (also e.g. nn.relu), this can be disabled since the scaling will be done by the next layer.

- renorm: Whether to use Batch Renormalization. This adds extra variables during training. The inference is the same for either value of this parameter.
